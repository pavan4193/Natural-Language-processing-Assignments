# Natural-Language-processing-Assignments


During my time as a Teaching Assistant during my graduate studies, I focused on developing assignments that covered various aspects of Natural Language Processing. I ensured that these assignments were designed to be easily comprehensible, fostering a positive learning environment for students. Additionally, I provided tutorials alongside the assignments to aid students in grasping the concepts more effectively. In class, I dedicated time to explaining these tutorials and concepts, further enhancing students' understanding during our sessions.
